cd "/home/jack-leszczynski/Desktop/ChosenLocal/Projects/Client Projects/Olimpia/OlimpiaWebsite"

# Authenticate with GitHub CLI (you'll use your browser)
gh auth login -h github.com

# Push all commits
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
1. Choose "GitHub.com"
2. Choose "HTTPS"
3. Choose "Login with a web browser"
4. Copy the code and press Enter
5. Paste the code in your browser
6. Authorize GitHub CLI

## Alternative: Push with Personal Access Token

If you prefer using a token:

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Olimpia Website"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Push with Token

```bash
cd "/home/jack-leszczynski/Desktop/ChosenLocal/Projects/Client Projects/Olimpia/OlimpiaWebsite"

# Push using token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/JackL725/olimpia-website.git main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" error?
The repository needs to exist on GitHub first:
```bash
gh repo create olimpia-website --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

### Still getting permission errors?
Make sure you're authenticated as JackL725:
```bash
gh auth status
# Should show: Logged in to github.com as JackL725
```

### Want to restore SSH pushing for other projects?
After pushing this project, restore your SSH config:
```bash
git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/
```

---

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that the repository exists: https://github.com/JackL725/olimpia-website
2. Verify your authentication: `gh auth status`
3. Try the web browser login method (easiest)

Good luck! 🚀
